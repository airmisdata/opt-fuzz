- avoid backward branches by default
- write the program that elaborates compressed functions
- would like a way to avoid adding branches and phis that break llvm
- remove unused parameters

- generate x-with-overflow calls and insert/extractvalue
- generate load/store/alloca
- generate calls to intrinsics
- support pointer types
