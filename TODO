- add an option (or make it the default) to jump only forward in
  the list of BBs
- suppress printing functions containing BBs with no predecessors
- write the program that elaborates compressed functions
- would like a way to avoid adding branches and phis that break llvm
- remove unused parameters
- use this syntax more for (auto &element : F) { }

- generate x-with-overflow calls and insert/extractvalue
- generate load/store/alloca
- generate calls to intrinsics
- support pointer types
